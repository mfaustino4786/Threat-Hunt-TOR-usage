# Threat Hunting Project – TOR Usage Scenario

This repository documents the end-to-end process of:

1. Creating and onboarding a Virtual Machine to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
2. Importing and filling out a Threat Event Template
3. Recreating simulated adversary activity to generate logs and IoCs
4. Hunting for indicators using MDE Kusto Query Language (KQL)
5. Producing a final threat hunting report

This project is part of a cybersecurity learning and threat hunting development exercise.
